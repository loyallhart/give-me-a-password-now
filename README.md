# give-me-a-password-now

## Description

### What was our motivation?

- I have been hired to modify starter code and create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

### Why did we build this project?

- I built this project to showcase my ability to use codittional logic with javascript. Using conditional statements to build a password generator wa a great opportunity to be creative in how we approached the job and met requirements.

### What did we learn? 

- In this project I learned how to do some of the following: 
    - assign variables
    - use the window.confirm method that returns a boolean indicating OK (true) or Cancel (false)
    - use the window.alert method
    - use the Logical AND operator for a set of of boolean operands
    - use the .concat method to return a new array by  merging 2 or more arrays
    - use the Conditional Statements "if and else"
    - use for statements to create loops
    
 
## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
